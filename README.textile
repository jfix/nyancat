h1. yet another nyancat

This is just a fun litle project that allows to have a nyancat run over a website when a certain key combination has been pressed. Right now it's five times the Shift key, but this could be changed quite easily.

It makes use of jquery, the nyancat image, and the sound (both ogg and mp3).

It should be as easy as inclusion of the following line at the end of your web page:

<pre>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://wherever.org/nc.js"></script>
</pre>

You will have to change one line in the @nc.js@ script as I haven't figured out how to use the script's location instead of the including page's location.  See line 5:

<pre>
var url = 'http://nc';
</pre>

Obviously, you'll need to set this to something that exists.


That's all folks!
